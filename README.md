# Description
This is the a simple Android application serving the purpose of a shopping list. It was originally done during my semester abroad in Poland at the [Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/). I modelled it after how I would use a piece of paper and kept it as simple as possible.

# Core features
- Simple and intuitive to use
- Dark and Light user interface
- Six choosable color schemes
- Localized in more than 15 languages
- No permissions required
- No tracking or sharing any data
- No ads

# Installation
Sadly I am too lazy to set everything up for the official app store. You can either
- install [the app](https://f-droid.org/packages/pl.edu.pjwstk.s999844.shoppinglist/) via the [F-Droid app registry](https://f-droid.org/)

or

- download the .apk file directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/Abrynos/ShoppingList/releases/latest) here on GitHub.

# Translation
I am open to translating the app to any known language. There is several ways of submitting your translation to the project:
- The easiest way is [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/abrynosshoppinglist). You can just input the strings into a graphical user interface and I will do the rest. Please open an issue if your preferred language is not available as an option.
- The second possibility is to open a merge request adding the translated strings in source code directly

# Collaboration

If you already have a specific idea but you are unable to find it in the list of previous suggestions you can either open an issue with your feature request or open a merge request directly.
